# Exploratory Data Analysis and NLP Downstream Tasks on Urdu Speech Dataset
## Introduction
Analysis of a curated Urdu speech dataset, followed by a range of natural language processing (NLP) downstream tasks. Urdu, one of the world's most widely spoken languages, offers a unique challenge for NLP due to its complex morphology and rich linguistic structure. 
Our exploration begins with an in-depth exploratory data analysis, investigating the dataset's characteristics, such as the distribution of speech samples across different domains, speakers, and speech durations. We will also examine the audio quality, annotation quality, and potential biases present in the dataset.
we will delve into NLP downstream tasks, including speech recognition, speaker identification, sentiment analysis, and topic classification, leveraging the Urdu speech dataset.
## Emotion Analysis
We are given four Emotions Happy, Angry, Sad and Neutral in form of Audio files on which we have to Perform the following Task
## Task Performed
1.  Data Pre-processing:- 
- This includes Merge the speeches of the same speaker into one file and convert the merged audio files into text using speech_recognition.
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Identify the top 10 most frequent words in the transcribed text for each emotion and plot them in a bar graph.
- Perform Word Cloud analysis to visualize the most frequent words in the transcribed text for each emotion.
- Calculate the average length of the transcribed text for each emotion and plot them in a bar graph.
- Analyze the sentiment polarity of the transcribed text for each emotion using Vader Sentiment Analysis and plot the results in a line graph.
- Identify the top 10 most frequent bigrams and trigrams in the transcribed text for each emotion and plot them in a bar graph.
3. Downstream NLP Tasks
- Text Classification on the generated transcription using scikit-learn library.
